# Text Editor PAW

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Description

This repository contains a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser. The application can be used to write and save code snippets or notes, both online and offline, by using IndexedDB for data storage and service workers for caching assets.

This project was built using Webpack and Workbox to ensure it meets PWA criteria and functions even when the user is offline. It allows users to create, retrieve, and store their content, which is then saved automatically when the user clicks off the window.

 ## Manifest

The application includes a manifest.json file generated by WebpackPwaManifest. This allows the application to be installed as a PWA! 

The manifest includes app icons for multiple sizes and defines the app's name, description, and theme colors. 

You can view more about this in the DevTools, under the Application tab!

### Service Worker

A service worker is used to cache static assets and pages for offline use. It is created using Workbox! The service worker is registered and runs in the background to provide offline functionality and improve load performance.
